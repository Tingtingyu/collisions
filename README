        INSTALLATION

In order to build this software, you will need to install :
  * Qt4
  * boost C++ libraries, headers version, available at :
http://www.boost.org/

Then, modify the file "collisions.pro" to set the path to boost headers :
INCLUDEPATH += /your/path/to/boost/

You can now compile this software using Qt. It was tested with
"Qt Creator" IDE.


        USAGE

You can create simulation projects which record initial conditions :
populations of particles (position, mass, initial speed...),
shapes of obstacles, gravity...

There is an edit mode to modify these projects and a simulation mode
to run them.


        PERFORMANCE

An efficient algorithm has been designed to model collisions and is able
to simulate one thousand particles at a rate of several thousands of
collisions per second (CPU 1,66 GHz).
